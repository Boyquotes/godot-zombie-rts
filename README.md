# Zombie RTS

A zombie themed real-time strategy game made to explore the Godot engine, available 
at [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/), and Unity.

## View the game in Godot
Follow these steps to view the game within the Godot engine, and play it:
* Download Godot 64 Bit (Mono) from the [official download page](https://godotengine.org/download/windows), 
version 3.2.1 or above __required__
* Navigate to the download and run Godot (no install required)
* Clone this repository
* Import the relevant director from this repository into Godot via the `Import` 
button in the _Project Manager_
* Press the _play_ icon to run the game

# Working on the code
Follow these steps to get started on editing the game code
* Use either [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=windows) 
or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for proper Godot support with C#, however 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is fine too.
* The [Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html) 
give instruction
on how to set up your IDE or Editor of choice for C# and Godot.
* DotNet 4.5 or above is currently required and can be downloaded 
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=30653).
* Follow the steps above for viewing the game, but configure Godot to open the scripts 
in your editor/IDE.
* Alternatively, the code can be opened as a project/solution in your IDE of choice.
